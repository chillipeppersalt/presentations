   >Basically it is  continously integrating new codes with existing one and automaically testing it and checking out the obtained codes behaviour
---

                           AUTODEPLOYMENT PROCESS
   
                               
- Developers scrutinize the code locally on the computer

- When inspection completes, the changes are commited to respective repositories.

- Then,Repositories are send the request to the CI system.
---


- CI system runs the job(test,coverage,check syntax etc)
 
- If build fails then the CI server reports it to the team.
    
- The team fixes it.

                            CONCULSION


 This  project is about content centric web-technologies which helps content-editor to focus on content rather than on designing it .It is made using tool named [JEKYLL](https://jekyllrb.com/) This will help in enchancement of matter as required time will be given to the content . 
---
Then it is build using TravisCI for deployment[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) .It is used to build & test software project hosted on github.The main agenda is to identify the problem that creeps in during the development process as early as possible so therefore compiled regularly.
