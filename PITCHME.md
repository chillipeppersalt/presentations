                           AUTODEPLOYMENT PROCESS
   
                               
- Developers scrutinize the code locally on the computer

- When inspection completes, the changes are commited to respective repositories.

- Then,Repositories are send the request to the CI system.
---


- CI system runs the job(test,coverage,check syntax etc)
 
- If build fails then the CI server reports it to the team.
    
- The team fixes it.

---
Then it is build using TravisCI for deployment[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) .It is used to build & test software project hosted on github.The main agenda is to identify the problem that creeps during the development process as early as possible.so therefore complied regularly.
